Somebody opened their eyes. They - or she, now that she had examined her body - looked around her surroundings.  
What is this place? she asked herself. She went through her memory, trying to figure out where she was, why she was here, how she got here, and, most importantly, 
why the hell she only had one pant sleeve on her leg. Not even a pair of pants, only one sleeve was really attached to the waist - 
her right leg had a really long boot or something. And her hands - white, leather gloves. Again, no memories. Weird, she thought. Can’t remember a thing. 
Pretty sure remembering things is normal. She was surrounded by trees. No, not trees, dead trees. Not a single leaf was visible, only blackened, petrified trees. 
And some mosses and shrubs on the ground. There were acorns growing on the trees, though. She picked a couple. They would probably come in handy later. 
She strained her eyes to try and figure out what the darkish blobs on the horizon were. In the distance, she could be what seemed to be a village.
Perhaps the villagers can help me - as long as that’s a village. Now with a plan, she stood up. Her pant - no, her deconstructed pants - crumpled.
A yellowed piece of paper fell from her pocket. She picked it up. 

‘To the reader -
You do not have any memory of yourself. 
You will get these memories back if you complete tasks for us. 
Your name is Ember Bhatonj. Nearby you will find a weapon. You may use it. 
We have given it to you. Your first task is to find and kill King Pyrrhoid. 
Signed,’

And there was some sort of indecipherable signature beneath it. She took some time to process the information.
Looking around again, she saw a blade hidden amongst the moss. She picked it up. 
“My name is Ember,” she said to nobody in particular. “Sounds like a nice name.”

The moss squelched under Ember’s feet. There was an acrid smell in the air, and a warm crackling sound. A fire, she assured herself.
She walked in the direction of the heat, until she came across a thick wall of the trees. Ember began to climb up the branches, before falling flat onto the ground with a thud.
She was in a clearing. The trees seemed to part around the source of the fire, complete with a small table, an array of cooking utensils, and a small blue book. 
A quaint leather pouch lay on the floor. The whole setup looked enticing. Stepping forward, Ember opened the book and began to read. 
The first page she saw was some sort of recipe. 
‘Power Noodles
Boil 5 handfuls of moss. Add ground sh’almonds. Serve the moss with the boiled water mixed with dew.’
I have to try this. Ember climbed back out of the clearing, tore some moss off the ground, threw it into the pot, and watched as it began to spread into some sort of noodles. 
She ground up the acorns the had picked earlier, which gave off a spicy odour, and dropped them into the pot as well. 
Plucking some twigs from the bushes, Ember shook off the sweet dew into the pot. She pulled out a bowl, poured a small portion into it, and haphazardly sipped at the broth. 
The flavours exploded in her mouth. Niuethgna awesome! 

Ember’s stomach growled. Dammit, she thought. I shouldn’t have eaten the whole pot. 
I need to get myself some food if I’m going to be stuck here until I defeat this King Pyramid guy.
She looked through the small bag she had looted, and found a couple of coins, a small flask of water, and some matches. No more food, though. Another growl sounded. 
That wasn’t my stomach. 
“Hello?” she called, before realising her mistake. An arm poked through the dense foliage, then a foot, and then the whole body. 
Some sort of short, beige humanoid with probably the same amount of hunger she had and a fierce look in its eyes stumbled into the clearing. 
It was holding a sword. “Hey! You! What do you want?” Ember yelled. The creature replied with a snort, before swiping its sword at the general location of Ember’s body.
“Whoa, there, buddy. I’m not that edible.” Another creature appeared from the trees.
Looks like I’m fighting these guys now, she thought. She drew her blade, and it shone in the light of the Grothpyr above. 
She rushed in, swinging the blade wildly and hoping it would connect, whilst trying to dodge as many attacks as she could. 
One of the creatures cut her forearm, leaving a trail of blood on the forest floor. 
Ember retaliated by aiming her blow at its head, and knew she had succeeded when she heard a soft groan followed by a thump as its body hit the floor. 
There wouldn’t be an easy escape, her blood would give her away. The surviving creature rushed up beneath her legs and stabbed her in the foot. Achutai! 
Ember yelled silently, before kicking away the creature into a tree. She threw her blade at the wood, and the threat was gone. 
At least she would have something else to eat now.
